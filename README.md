##Overview
This analysis was performed per a client's request to visualize and compare various enviornmentally friendly, "green" stocks' performancse over varying one year periods. The given data for the analyses was from 2017 and 2018, but the visualization program can be used to interpret datasets from different years if the data is provided for those stocks in Microsoft Excel in the same format. The stocks' return rate can be visualized as either positive or negative for the given year, and can be interpreted going from to one year to another in order for the client to make the desired selections based on the data. 
##Results
The data from 2017 shows positive returns on all data sets except one (TERP). However going into 2018, this postive return only continued for two stocks (RUN and ENPH).
